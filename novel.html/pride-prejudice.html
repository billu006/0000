    <p><strong>Pride and Prejudice,</strong> romantic novel by <em>Jane Austen,</em> published anonymously in three
        volumes in 1813. A classic of English literature, written with incisive wit and superb character delineation, it
        centers on the burgeoning relationship between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman, and
        Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. Upon publication, Pride and Prejudice was well received by
        critics and readers. The first edition sold out within the first year, and it never went out of print.</p>
    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>Pride and Prejudice is set in rural England at the turn of the 19th century, and it follows the Bennet family,
        which includes five very different sisters. The eldest, Jane, is sweet-tempered and modest. She is her sister
        Elizabeth’s confidant and friend. Elizabeth, the heroine of the novel, is intelligent and high-spirited. She
        shares her father’s distaste for the conventional views of society as to the importance of wealth and rank. The
        third daughter, Mary, is plain, bookish, and pompous, while Lydia and Kitty, the two youngest, are flighty and
        immature.</p>
