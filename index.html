    <h1>Exploring the World of Literature.</h1>
    <p><strong>World literature</strong> is used to refer to the total of the world's national literature and the
        circulation of works into the wider world beyond their country of origin In the past, it primarily referred to
        the masterpieces of Western European literature; however, world literature today is increasingly seen in an
        international context. Now, readers have access to a wide range of global works in various translations.</p>
    <p><em>Johann Wolfgang Goethe</em> used the concept of world literature in several of his essays in the early
        decades of the nineteenth century to describe the international circulation and reception of literary works in
        Europe,</p>
