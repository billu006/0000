    <h1>Exploring the World of Literature.</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>World literature</strong> is used to refer to the total of the
      world's national literature and the circulation of works into the wider
      world beyond their country of origin In the past, it primarily referred to
      the masterpieces of Western European literature; however, world literature
      today is increasingly seen in an international context. Now, readers have
      access to a wide range of global works in various translations.
    </p>

      <em>Johann Wolfgang Goethe</em> used the concept of world literature in
      several of his essays in the early decades of the nineteenth century to
      describe the international circulation and reception of literary works in
      Europe,

    <h2>Dive Deeper into Literature</h2>
    <p>
      Diving deep into literature has its own glee and joy. Taking out an
      imaginary magnifying glass and pouring through the pages and the words of
      a text is a lot like looking for treasure!
    </p>
    <p>
      Literature is a conversation. All art is. All art is merely translations.
      One mind to another. When writers write a story, poem, play, essay, or
      anything, they are putting down something that is to be translated. We may
      speak the same languages, some of us, but these languages are just tools,
      shapes, and faceless jigsaw pieces that donâ€™t have intrinsic meaning until
      bestowed upon them. Only until we have sorted through them with our own
      mind can meaning and expression be fulfilled.
